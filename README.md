## ** IMPORTANT NOTE **

## The MongoDB collections for the back-end of this project have unfortunately been erased due to inactivity and therefore our dummy data skateboards are not able to be rendered on our index.html page at this moment. 

## All of our code is still attached and we still encourage you to check out our front-end and back-end code linked in our respositories while this issue is being addressed. Thank you.
